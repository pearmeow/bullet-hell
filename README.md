Requirement 1: Menu Screen (10%)
--------------------------------

- [x] Show the name of your game and the text “Press enter to start” (or any variation thereof)
- [x] The menu must be a different Scene object. 
- [x] It must also show the instructions

Requirement 2: 2 Minutes of Gameplay (40%)
------------------------------------------

- [ ] Must have 2 minutes worth of significant gameplay. This does not mean exactly 2 minutes, but rather that the game can go on for 2+ minutes. 
- [ ] Your character must be fully animated.
- [ ] If your idea doesn't revolve around multi-level-based design, whatever scene structure that you implement must contain around the same quantity of content as a 3-level game.

Requirement 3: Moving AI (20%)
------------------------------

- [x] There should be at least three distinct types of AI Entities. 
- [x] They must transform in some way.
- [x] At least one of them must animate
- [x] These don't necessarily need to be enemies! Homing projectiles, moving platforms/obstacles also count as long as they are distinct from each other in behaviour.

Requirement 4: Players Can Win and Lose (10%)
---------------------------------------------

- [x] Some way for the player to lose (touching an AI, falling off a ledge, running out of time, etc.) 
- [x] Some way for the player to win (defeating all AI, collecting all the coins, etc.)

Requirement 5: Shader Logic (10%)
---------------------------------

- [ ] Use at least one logic-based (i.e. if-statements) shader effect.
- [ ] It can be any of the ones we talked about in class (or of your own design), but it must contribute to the overall theme and experience of your game (i.e. don't just make the screen red for the sake of it).

Requirement 6: Audio (10%)
--------------------------

- [x] You must have at least 1 looping background music for each level.
